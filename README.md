# Getting and cleaning data: course project

About the data:
The data represent data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. The variables in the data X are sensor signals measured with waist-mounted smartphone from 30 subjects. The variable in the data Y indicates activity type the subjects performed during recording.

More information can be found at the data source website: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones


run_analysis.R contains all the code to perform the analyses described in the 5 steps. They can be launched in RStudio by just importing the file. Here are the five steps:

 1.Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
 2.Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
 3.Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
 4.Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
 5.From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject. TidyData.txt is the output of the final step.


 - 1.First, download and unzip the data file into your R working directory.
 - 2.Second, download the R source code into your R working directory.
 - 3.Finally, execute R source code to generate tidy data file.
